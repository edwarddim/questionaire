## BACKGROUND INFORMATION
This Questionnaire project was made with React/Redux and Express/MongoDB. It is my first project using React/Redux. The project is a questionnaire in which the admin can create a questionnaire from scratch and send out response forms to users to fill out. 

## INSTRUCTIONS TO START
You will need to have a mongodb server running on your local machine. Once up, all you need to do is start the React build with "npm start" and "nodemon server.js" from project level. The project runs on localhost:3000 and the express server runs on localhost:8000
